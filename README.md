Pixels needs **WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS** permission in order to work (this is NOT rooting). 

----------------------
### TLDR

 * Execute `adb shell pm grant com.tribalfs.siesta android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS`
 
----------------------
### 1. Enable developer mode in phone's settings

 * Go to `Settings` > `About phone` > `Software information` and tap `Build number` multiple times until the developer mode is enabled.

### 2. Enable USB debugging

 * Go to `Settings` > `Developer options` (can be `Settings` > `System` > `Developer options` on older android versions), scroll down and find `USB debugging` option.

### 3. Download ADB on your computer

 * Download ADB (platform-tools) to your computer:
    for [Windows](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip) |
    for [Mac](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-darwin.zip) |
    for [Linux](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-linux.zip)
    
 * Extract the downloaded zip file.

### 4. Navigate to inside of `platform-tools` folder that you extracted on  Windows Explorer or Finder(macOS)


### 5. Opening the command-line interface

#### For Windows: Open up CMD
  
 * Type `cmd` in the address bar and press enter.  This will open Windows Command Prompt.

#### For MacOS: Open up Terminal

 * Search `Terminal` from Launchpad and run it.

 * Run `sudo -s` and type your user password. **The terminal won't display how much characters you type, it'll remain blank.**

 * Run `export PATH=.:$PATH`

 **Without this, you will get `adb: command not found` errors.**


### 6. Connecting your phone to your computer

 * Your phone will prompt `Allow USB debugging` if it's the first time being connected on USB debugging mode.  Tap `OK`.


![adb prompt](usb_debugging_prompt.jpg)

 * Check the connection by entering the following command followed by an enter. It should show your device ID if successfully connected.

 ```adb devices```

For macOS:  ```./adb devices ```
 
  * If your device fails to connect to your computer, try connecting it a different USB port and/or using a different USB data cable. If still not connecting, your computer is possibly missing the USB driver for your phone. Check [here to download OEM USB drivers](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/oem-usb#Drivers). Once installed, reboot your PC and redo step no. 6. 


### 7. Actual granting of WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS permission to Siesta

 * When successfully connected, enter the following command and press enter. You can copy the command below.  If the command is executed properly, it will return blank.

 ```adb shell pm grant com.tribalfs.siesta android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS```

![6](write_secure_settings.png)

For macOS: ```./adb shell pm grant com.tribalfs.siesta android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS ```

Note: On some MIUI devices you need to enable the option "Disable permission Monitoring" under "Developer options" to be able to grant this permission.



### 8. You may now disable the USB debugging settings

 * If you don't need USB debugging, it's recommended to disable it to avoid potential unwanted access.

 * Go to `Settings` > `Developer options`, scroll down a page and **disable** `USB debugging` option.

**That's it!**

You don't have to repeat this process unless you completely uninstall the app and reinstall it.
